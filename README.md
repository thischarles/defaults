# My Defaults

## .zshrc
I just like colors and emojis. 😌

Goes in `~/.zshrc`.

And don't forget to `source ~/.zshrc` because I always do.

## /scripts
Don't forget to make scripts executable with `chmod +x` because I know I will.

| Script | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| sudotouchid.sh | Enable Touch ID for sudo (requires sudo) |
| defaults.sh | macOS Settings to my liking |

Tip: Experimenting with `defaults read` to get settings while changing settings when creating your own defaults.sh.

## Homebrew for me.terminal
Mac Terminal profile file. Just default Homebrew profile with a 14 point font and a little more transparency.

## /AppleScript
Too bad Apple effectively deprecated `sfltool` and doesn't have Property List files for some Finder settings. There are other tools for automating Finder settings, but I decided to use Apple Script.

| Script | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Finder Favorites.scpt | Add Sidebar Favorites in Finder via Finder Settings |
| Developer folder.scpt | Creates a Developer folder in the Home directory and adds to Favorites |
